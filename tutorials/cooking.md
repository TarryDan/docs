# Using Grocy: track your cooking!

## Goal
Grocy lets you keep all your recipes in one place, use them in meal plans, and even search through your recipes for one or more which use an ingredient that you already have!

## Before you start
You will need:
- a working Grocy app or installation
- locations set up in your master data for your products
- units set up in your master data for your products
- product groups set up in your master data for your products
- some good recipes!

## Recipes

### Add a new recipe

1. Navigate to recipes on the side menu and click `Add`.
2. Fill out the Name, Servings, etc. and the press `Save & continue` to make the ingredients list appear.

3. Fill out ingredients
  - Don't worry if you haven't added one to your products before: by pressing <kbd>tab</kbd> after filling out the name, a product window will pop up, letting you fill out all the details.
  - Under _variable amount_ you can set amounts that are different from your stock and purchase amounts and units. This will show up instead of the number under Amount.
  - Disable stock fulfillment checking for this ingredient: if checked, the system won't check if you have any of this stocked. Useful for ingredients you don't mind leaving out.
  - _Group_ allows you to have sections in your ingredients list.
4. Fill out your instructions
5. Add serving amount

### Working with recipes

Once you've added your recipes, you can see them all under the recipes side menu.

If you select a recipe, you can also see all at once what you have in stock, that is, what you can make! The icons on top also let you consume (that is, remove the given amount from your inventory), put missing products onto your shopping list, as well as edit or delete the recipe itself. When the products have prices attached, the total cost will also be displayed.

## Meal plan

Once you have some recipes set up, you can use the meal plan function to plan out your week comfortably.

1. Navigate to _Meal plan_ in the side menu.

2. You can add a recipe to a day by clicking on the plus; all previously added recipes can be searched for here, and the serving size set.

3. By clicking on the arrow down, you can add a note or a particular product.

If you set prices for your products and thus the recipes, Grocy will display the weekly cost on top. You can also easily add missing items to your shopping list or consume those specified in the recipes.
